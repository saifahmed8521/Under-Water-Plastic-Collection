st.markdown("We need to clean the ocean because, well, it's where all the cool sea creatures live, and we can't let them swim in a garbage dump! Plus, nobody wants to surf on a plastic wave or have their beach vacation ruined by a plastic picnic. Let's tidy up the ocean and give marine life the clean, blue playground they deserve! ðŸŒŠðŸ§¹")

st.title(":red[Why] It Matters")
st.markdown("It matters because our oceans are suffocating under a deluge of plastic, a crisis that threatens the very essence of life on Earth. From majestic marine mammals to delicate coral reefs, no corner of our blue planet is spared. Yet, in this dire struggle, lies a chance for redemption. By confronting this crisis head-on, we're not just saving marine life; we're rewriting the narrative of our planet's future. It's a battle against time, against apathy, against the forces of destruction. But with every piece of plastic removed, we're breathing life back into the veins of our oceans, igniting a beacon of hope that echoes across generations. So, yes, it matters more than words can convey. It's the ultimate showdown between despair and redemption, and we're the protagonists in this epic tale of salvation.")
